# Catcha

A Palworld-themed idle/clicker in the spirit of PokéClicker. Browser-only, saves to `localStorage`.

Design notes: [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md).

## Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Scripts

| Command         | What                                   |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------|
| `npm run dev`   | Vite dev server with HMR               |
| `npm run build` | Production build into `dist/`          |
| `npm run check` | Type-check `.ts` and `.svelte` files   |
| `npm test`      | Vitest — engine unit tests             |

## Layout

```
src/
  data/     static content: Pals, routes, items, spheres, element chart  (no logic)
  engine/   pure game logic: combat, catching, party, progress, save     (no DOM, tested)
  state/    game.svelte.ts — the single reactive Game store the UI reads
  ui/       Svelte components, one per screen
```

Balance knobs live in `src/engine/formulas.ts` and `src/data/spheres.ts`.

## Status

Region 1 (Windswept Hills) is playable: 7 routes, 2 Alphas, the Rayne Syndicate Tower, 32 Pals,
catching, party, Paldeck, merchant, save/export/import. Base building, breeding, condensing and
the tech tree are next — see DESIGN.md §10.
